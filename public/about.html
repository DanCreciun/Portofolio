<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi! I’m a passionate and driven junior web developer with a love for building clean, responsive, and user-friendly websites. Fresh into the professional world of web development, I bring a strong foundation in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and modern frameworks like React. My journey started with a curiosity about how websites work, which quickly turned into a full-on commitment to learning and creating.</p>

<p>I thrive in environments where I can learn, collaborate, and solve real-world problems through code. Whether it's fixing a tricky bug, building a new feature, or improving performance, I enjoy every step of the development process. I’m especially excited about front-end development and how good design meets great functionality.</p>

<p>What sets me apart is my eagerness to grow. I’m constantly exploring new tools, reading up on best practices, and taking on projects that push my limits. I believe that great developers never stop learning—and I’m just getting started.</p>
